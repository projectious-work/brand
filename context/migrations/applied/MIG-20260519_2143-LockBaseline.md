# Migration MIG-20260519_2143-LockBaseline

`aibox.lock` schema extended in v0.25.6 to record the previously
applied addon-tool and harness selection (DEC-20260508_1515-SilentAsh,
BR-CLEANUP-ARCH item 1). This backfill captures the current selection
as the baseline so the next `aibox apply` can compute a removal diff
when a tool or harness is disabled.

Backfilled previous_selection: 6 addon(s), 17 tool(s), 2 harness(es)

## Backfilled addon selection

- `audio-voice`: alsa-pulse, pulseaudio-utils, sox, sox-pulse
- `docs-hugo`: hugo
- `git-ui`: gh
- `node`: node, pnpm
- `preview-archive`: chafa, entr, librsvg, mupdf, p7zip, poppler, resvg, timg
- `preview-enhanced`: rich

## Backfilled harness selection

- claude, codex

## Next action

Acknowledge with the migration-management skill (`/pk-resume` will
surface it). No code change is required — the next `aibox apply`
will use this baseline automatically.
